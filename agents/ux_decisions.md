# UX Guidelines — Situational Patterns

## Editing rules

Entries here are tied to a specific interaction or component. Include concrete file names and method/class/variable names — that's what makes this file useful as a "what already exists" reference before inventing a new pattern. Do not include line numbers; they go stale.

Rules that apply broadly, independent of any specific interaction or component, belong in [ux_guidelines_general.md](ux_guidelines_general.md) instead.

This is a living document. Extend it, don't replace it.

## Gestures

Gesture thresholds (velocity, distance) start from industry-standard values, defined as named constants in `src/config/*.ts` (see `src/config/location.ts`, `src/config/tutorial.ts`) — never hardcoded inline, never a user-facing setting.

**Swipe-to-dismiss**: an upward swipe on a photo unassigns it from the current cat only (soft dismiss — pool and other cats' assignments untouched), distinct from the destructive long-press Remove (`useAnnotateStateMachine.ts`'s `handleLongPressRemove`, which deletes the photo from the whole submission). Pair every dismiss with the Undo bubble.

**Gesture composition**: when a new gesture lands on a surface that already owns a conflicting one (e.g. `AnnotateCarouselItem.tsx`'s `photoGesture` owns pan/pinch/double-tap for bounding-box framing), gate it with `Gesture.Race(existingGesture, newGesture)` so it only arms when the existing gesture isn't mid-pan/mid-pinch. Don't carve out a separate dead zone unless explicitly asked.

## Undo bubble

Transient, dismissible confirmation shown after a soft/reversible destructive action (e.g. swipe-to-dismiss), positioned ~1/5 of the screen height from the top. Distinct from `Alert.alert` confirmations — the bubble appears after the action (optimistic/reversible); `Alert.alert` gates before an action that can't be undone.

## Confirmations & destructive actions

Existing pattern (`useCatSubmit.ts`'s `handleReset`, `useAnnotateStateMachine.ts`'s `handleLongPressRemove`): irreversible actions go through `Alert.alert` with `{ text: 'Cancel', style: 'cancel' }` first and the destructive option styled `style: 'destructive'`. Where confirmation would repeat needlessly, offer a "Remove, don't ask again" option that persists a `skip_*_confirm` flag to `useSettingsStore` (see `skip_photo_remove_confirm`) — never skip by default, only after opt-out.

## Status / warning indicators

Inline status pairs icon + label, not a modal: `AlertCircle` (warning color) when a value needs attention, `CheckCircle` (success color) when resolved, each with an `accessibilityLabel` describing state and available action (see `create/index.tsx`'s location/time status row). Tapping the icon is only enabled while the warning state is active.

## Home entrypoint buttons

Home's two entry actions (`src/screens/home/index.tsx`) are circular, side by side, sized via `computeEntrypointDiameter` (`src/lib/home/entrypointDiameter.ts`) — not a fixed diameter. Formula: `buffer = min(screenWidth, screenHeight) * ENTRYPOINT_BUFFER_PERCENT`, `diameter = (screenWidth - 2*buffer - ENTRYPOINT_GAP_DP) / 2`, both constants in `src/config/constants.ts` (`ENTRYPOINT_BUFFER_PERCENT` default `0.075`, `ENTRYPOINT_GAP_DP` default `24`). "Buffer" is read as screen-edge-to-circle-edge, scaled off the *shorter* screen side so the inset stays proportional across orientations — the longer side only affects diameter, not buffer size. Floored at `MIN_TOUCH_TARGET_DP` (48, matching `ux_principles.md`'s touch-target minimum) so a narrow/foldable screen can't shrink the circles below tappable.

Each circle carries a visible text label (`AppButton`'s `size="circle"` variant, icon above label, both inside the circle) — not caption-below or icon-only: "Take Photos" (camera, `variant="primary"`) and "Upload Photos" (library, `variant="secondary"`). `ENTRYPOINT_GAP_DP` is a plain number, not `theme.spacing.xxl`, so the sizing formula stays independent of the theme object — deliberate, don't fold it back into a theme lookup.
