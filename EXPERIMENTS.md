# Experiments

Started 2026-09-25 by the `improve-app` journey. Tracking issue
matthewdmanning/feral-spotter#371.

**Standing constraint:** the app has no real users yet, so no row below can be validated by live data
today. Each row carries a pre-committed metric to be read once the beta cohort exists (Task #7 in
`PROJECT_STATUS.md`). Until then a shipped fix is verified by a device test drive, not by a metric.

## Experiment Cards

### EXP-001 — Make the submit moment answer "did it work?"

- Hypothesis: First-time submitters will understand that their Sighting was sent if the app confirms
  the completed upload and names the destination, because today success returns silently to Home.
- Type: moderated task-comprehension check once a beta cohort exists; device test drive until then
- Primary metric and threshold (pre-committed): share of participants who can correctly say whether
  the Sighting was submitted and where it went, without a hint immediately after the task. Threshold:
  improvement over a pre-fix comprehension baseline, to be captured before this fix reaches beta users.
- Guardrail metric: no increase in failed or abandoned submit attempts during the task
- Decision rule: if users still cannot tell what happened, revise the receipt and test it again.
- Result and verdict: not started
- Covers: U1, U2

## Experiment Backlog

Ordered by severity × frequency, per the Phase 2 decision. Ease does not enter the ordering; the ICE
column is recorded but does not reorder the list.

| # | Idea | Finding | ICE (impact/confidence/ease) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Render the submit state — disable the button, change the label, show progress. The flag already exists and is unused | U1 (#372) | 9 / 9 / 9 | issue filed |
| 2 | Confirm the Submission landed and say what happens to it next | U2 (#373) | 9 / 7 / 7 | issue filed |
| 3 | Give the first annotate entry an instruction that does not wait on the gated tutorial | U3 (#374) | 9 / 8 / 6 | issue filed |
| 4 | State the reason beside every disabled control (4 sites) | U4 (#375) | 7 / 9 / 8 | issue filed |
| 5 | Give the annotate pass an explicit forward control | U5 (#376) | 8 / 8 / 7 | issue filed |
| 6 | Rewrite the submit failure message to what/why/how, and say the draft is safe | U11 (#377) | 7 / 9 / 9 | issue filed |
| 7 | Render a human label on cat rows, with a distinct one for an all-unknown cat | U13 (#378) | 6 / 9 / 9 | issue filed |
| 8 | Answer the Android back press in annotate instead of swallowing it | U6 | 7 / 8 / 6 | backlog |
| 9 | Split "Done With This Cat" into one label per outcome | U7 | 7 / 8 / 7 | backlog |
| 10 | Give a draft a non-destructive way out that keeps the work | U8 | 8 / 7 / 5 | backlog |
| 11 | Surface the location fix state on the camera screen | U14 | 7 / 7 / 6 | backlog |
| 12 | Say a draft went stale instead of silently hiding Continue | U12 | 6 / 8 / 7 | backlog |
| 13 | Explain "Ear Tipped" with a drawing | U9 | 7 / 7 / 8 | drawing planned |
| 14 | Replace Cat Form's "Clear" confirmation with undo | U10 | 6 / 7 / 6 | Phase 3 |
| 15 | Make the annotate trash act, with undo, instead of teaching a gesture by dialog | U19 | 5 / 8 / 7 | Phase 3 |
| 16 | Separate the attributes the dataset needs from the nice-to-have ones | U22 | 8 / 5 / 4 | Phase 3 |
| 17 | Apply “Sighting” across Home, final action, and list; choose one ownership-field label separately | U15–U17 (#380), U21 | 6 / 6 / 7 | issue filed; field label pending |
| 18 | Make Take Photos the Home primary action; check whether Submission's full-width action stack needs clearer grouping | U18 (#379) | 6 / 7 / 6 | issue filed for Home; Submission check pending |
| 19 | Label annotate's dot states | U20 | 4 / 8 / 8 | backlog |
| 20 | Add a visible cancel to Cat Form | U23 | 5 / 8 / 8 | backlog |
| 21 | Show "Open Settings" only after a permission denial | U24 | 3 / 8 / 9 | backlog |
| 22 | Use one label shape in the status row | U25 | 2 / 8 / 9 | backlog |

### Added by the error-design pass (design-everyday-things), 2026-09-25

Ordered by severity × frequency, continuing the list above. Rows that only cross-reference a
usability-pass finding are not repeated here.

| # | Idea | Finding | ICE (impact/confidence/ease) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 23 | Show each Cat Form attribute's standing value in the form, so the save-time "N fields not set" dialog is not needed | N1 | 8 / 7 / 5 | open |
| 24 | Show photo upload state where the photos are, not only when it stalls a submit | N4 | 7 / 8 / 5 | open |
| 25 | Give the two "Remove this cat?" dialogs one title each | N2 | 6 / 9 / 9 | open |
| 26 | Clear the Cat Form at once with an Undo, and drop the dialog that claims it cannot be undone | N3 | 6 / 8 / 8 | decided |
| 27 | Add an Undo after a cat is removed, keeping the confirmation in front of it | N3, N10 | 6 / 7 / 6 | decided |
| 28 | Make the annotate trash remove the photo, with an Undo, instead of opening a dialog that teaches a gesture | N10, U19 | 5 / 8 / 7 | decided |
| 29 | Make the good and the poor location states look different in kind, so a tick does not read as a dead control | N5 | 4 / 7 / 8 | open |

### Added by the in-app copy pass (made-to-stick), 2026-09-25

| # | Idea | Finding | Pre-committed check | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 30 | Correct Onboarding's setup claims; remove the unmeasured “About a minute” promise | U26 (#381) | In a first-run comprehension test, participants know the next step asks them to choose how to sign in, without being led | issue filed; claim verification pending |

### Added by the microinteractions pass, 2026-09-25

Ordered by severity × frequency, continuing the list above. Rows 24 and 27 already cover upload state
and remove-Undo from the error-design pass and are not repeated.

| # | Idea | Finding | Pre-committed check | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 31 | Give `AppButton` a pressed state, so every button in the app answers a touch before its action completes | M1 | On a device, each button visibly changes between touch-down and release on both platforms | open |
| 32 | Wire the existing `isSubmitting` flag into the `Finished!` button's existing `loading` prop | M2, U1 (#372) | Tapping Submit shows a waiting state until the app leaves the screen, however brief, and a second tap cannot start a second submit | open |
| 33 | Give the reports list a loading state and a read-failure state, so "No reports yet" only means no reports | M-reports | A returning user with saved Sightings never sees the empty state, and a read failure says so instead of showing an empty list | open |
| 34 | Confirm that Reset cleared the draft, instead of returning to Home silently | M-reset | After Reset, the user can say what happened without being asked to guess | open |
| 35 | Add one haptic at capture and one at a confirmed submit, and nowhere else | M4 | Both fire once per event on a device, and the app is fully usable with system haptics off | open |

### Added by the visual pass (refactoring-ui), 2026-09-25

No new tokens. Every row corrects a misuse of an existing primitive.

| # | Idea | Finding | Pre-committed check | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 36 | Make Take Photos the visual lead on Home: full diameter and filled `primary`, with Upload Photos at about 70% diameter and outlined `secondary` | H1 (#379) | On a render, a blurred and a grayscale screenshot both show one clear primary | open |
| 37 | Rebuild the Submission action block — Reset to the header row, `Finished!` filled `primary` at `typography.base` and last, Add More Photos outlined `secondary`, Add a Cat unchanged | S1, S4, S6 | A blurred screenshot shows one dominant action, and the primary is no longer smaller than a cat row | open |
| 38 | Route all four Submission actions through `AppButton` instead of hand-rolled `Pressable`s | S5 | No bespoke button styles remain in `submission/create/index.styles.ts` | open |
| 39 | Split the uniform root gap: `spacing.xxxl` between groups, `spacing.md` inside the action stack | S2 | Measured gaps between groups exceed gaps inside them on a render | open |
| 40 | Put the three off-scale values back on the scale, and pass tokens rather than numbers at the `BottomButtonColumn` call site | S3, H2 | No raw spacing number remains in either screen | open |
| 41 | Make New Sighting `secondary` so Continue Observation leads the resume pair | H3 | A blurred screenshot of the resume column shows one lead | open |

### Added by the copy pass (made-to-stick), 2026-09-26

Every row is a copy change except row 46, which is a decision the maintainer owns. No row alters the data
model: row 44 relabels a field and leaves `owned_domesticated` and its three values untouched.

| # | Idea | Finding | Pre-committed check | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 43 | Cut the unmeasured "About a minute" from slide 2 | Onboarding steps | No onboarding sentence asserts a duration the project cannot show | open |
| 44 | Relabel the Cat Form field `Owned / Domesticated` — label undecided | Cat Form | The label names one judgment the observer can make from the animal in front of them; the persisted key and values are unchanged | blocked: behavior and appearance labels both rejected 2026-09-26 — a dumped pet can be too scared to approach, and grooming or a collar does not separate feral from abandoned (owner: user) |
| 45 | Explain ear tipping with a drawing of a clipped ear tip beside the Ear Tipped field | Cat Form | A first-time user answers Ear Tipped without leaving the form to look the term up | drawing planned (owner: user) |
| 47 | Name no sign-in provider anywhere in Onboarding — say "choose how to sign in" | Onboarding setup | No screen names a provider, so no copy can promise a choice the release does not have | open |
