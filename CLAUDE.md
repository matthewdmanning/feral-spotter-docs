Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Be honest about confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- Only implement the features that were requests.
- Only use abstraction for reusable, multicode or when explicitly told to.
- Only catch errors for realistic problems that wouldn't cause a similar error or exception.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.
- Document changes. Change docstrings only for the parts that you changed directly.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

## 5. ESLint Resolver Errors

If `expo lint` reports `Resolve error: typescript with invalid interface loaded as resolver` across all TypeScript files, run `~/.claude/agents/scripts/eslint-resolver-diagnose.sh <any-ts-file>` before investigating further. This project has had stale-cache false positives after resolver package version changes.

## 6. Session Notes

2026-07-02 — audited all `useEffect` calls against React "You Might Not Need an Effect" docs. Removed unnecessary effects in `usePhotoSession`, `useAnnotateStateMachine`, `useSettingsDraft`, `useFeralReports`, and `submission/create`. See `.claude/useeffect-audit.md` (local only) for full findings.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests that check for invalid inputs and incorrect results for valid inputs."
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces the bug, then make it pass by fixing buggy code."

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```
